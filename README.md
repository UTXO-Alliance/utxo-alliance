### Who we are

The UTXO Alliance is a collaboration of Layer-1 (L1) blockchains and other organizations spearheading advancements of the Unspend Transation Output (UTXO) computing model to widespread its adoption and extend commercial partnerships.



### Why the UTXO model matters

The UTXO computing paradigm in blockchains offers a shophisticated design for building blockchain infrastructure L1s and decentralized applications. 

Among its design advantages we can highlight: true determinism, high concurrency and a useful framework for applying mathematical formal methods.

Moreover, we firmly believe that UTXO-based applications are better positioned to deliver on the promises of the blockchain industry offering greater security and scalability that directly downstreams from the computing model itself. 

Thus, it is crucial to open up paths for developers to join any Alliance member's ecosystem offering a promising alternative to the default 'account model' path as the only way into Web3.


### Active areas of collaboration

The UTXO Alliance proposes workstreams that can more efficiently cover a diversity of goals. Each workstream makes progress via dedicated working groups. These are flexible, can be proposed by members of the Alliance to tackle any particular area of work, and can dissolve if the goal is accomplished.

Current active working groups:

- [**Content working group**]() - 
- [**Technical working group**]() -
